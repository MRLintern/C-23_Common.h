## Common.h
* This header file is required for some aspects of programming in `C++23`; it may come in handy at some point in the near future...
* It contains `template code` that facilitates the use of `C++23 functions`. e.g.
    * `std::print()`
    * `std::println()`
    * `std::format()`
    * `std::vformat()`
 
* Essentially, I just want a safe place for this file.
